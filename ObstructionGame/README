About the program
*******************
This is a game of obstruction where the players can not place their markers on blocked places.
The last person to make a move on the board wins.

*******
Extras
*******

The extra 20% that I did was the following.
I added colour where the x (green) and o(cyan) are placed, and the surrounding boxes are red.
I made the cursor automatically go to the next available place, which is a hint.

************
Compilation
************

In order to compile the program, run the makefile. 
From the lx terminal open the A1 folder ( cd Desktop/cis2500/a1 ).
Then type in ./makeFile.sh .

***********************
Running the program

Then type in ./src/a1.c.

*****************
Known Limitations

The users can not quit the file until two names are typed in.
In order to move, or select, lower case letters must be used. 
If a player's name is longer than 50 characters the game may crash.
