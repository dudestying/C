I created this program for a class. Some of the code was taken from my professor, Xiling Li.
_____________________________________________________________________
This program compiles by running the makefile.
_____________________________________________________________________
This is done by typing "make -f Makefile"
_____________________________________________________________________
This program should display no compilation errors.
There may be some warnings.
If an error occurs it may potentially be in the output.
_____________________________________________________________________
To run the program, type
"./msh.exe"
_____________________________________________________________________
This program makes a shell. A shell is a program which allows a user to be able to call system commands and perform different tasks.
This is completed by having the user type in commands which are then read and executed by the program.

This shell is able to run the system calls with or without arguements.
It can also be exited by calling "quit", "exit", "leave" or "done".
In order to print out the name of the creator of the program, the user may type in "who" which will state that it was made by Salma Mobasher.
If a user enters a command not recognized by the system, the program will say so.
_____________________________________________________________________
There are a few limitations in this program.
When exiting, the user may type "quit", "exit", "leave" or "done", however it must be the first 
word on the line, and all the letters must not be capitalized.
_____________________________________________________________________
The algorithm of the program is a giant while loop as provided by the prof, 
with multuple if statements occuring when the program reads each inputted command.
This seemed to be a reasonable and simple way to execute what has been created and to keep a consistent code.
For most of the assignment I used the functions that the professor provided in his handout.

The references for this program were the code given to the class by the professor, as well as a few links which I will leave below
