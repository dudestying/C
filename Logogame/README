About the program
*******************

This is a mimic of the original logo interprater.
The functions it performs are fd, bk, rt, lt, st, ht, pu, pd, setpencolor, clean, bye and home.
Once you have run the program, type one of the above commands and press enter. 
The bk, rt, lt, fd, bk, and setpencolor functions require a number to be entered following the command.
In order to exit, type bye.
To change the colors of the border, change the color of the cursor, then type clean.

Extras
*******

The extra 20% that I created was the "st"(show turtle), "ht"(hide turtle), and clean.

************

In order to compile the program, run the makefile. 
From the lx terminal open the A2 folder ( cd Desktop/cis2500/A2 ).
Then type in "make".

***********************
Running the program
***********************

To run the program, open the A2 folder (as mentioned above).
Then type in ./bin/runMe .

*****************
Known Limitations
*****************

The program does not run if the user presses the arrow keys on the keyboard.
If the user continuously presses the arrow keys on the keyboard without pressing enter the code breaks.
The user can not input any angles to turn other than 90 degrees.
Each command is case sensitive and the user must enter the commands exactly as written.
